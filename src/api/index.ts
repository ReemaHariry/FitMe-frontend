/**
 * API Barrel Export
 * 
 * This file re-exports everything from the API modules.
 * This allows you to import from '@/api' instead of '@/api/auth' or '@/api/client'.
 * 
 * Usage examples:
 * - import apiClient from '@/api'
 * - import { authApi, login, register } from '@/api'
 * - import { usersApi, saveProfile } from '@/api'
 * - import { reportsApi, getAllReports } from '@/api'
 * - import type { AuthUser, AuthResponse, ProfileData, ReportSummary } from '@/api'
 */
